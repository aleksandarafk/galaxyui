# GalaxyUI

This repository contains the code for my individual PWA assignment, made for semester 4 ICT & Smart Mobile in preparation for my duo project.

## How to set up and run the project ?
There are no third party plugins for the project, all you have to do is clone this repository. (Some functions work only on mobile)

## Contents
The 'GalaxyUI' application consists of (functions):
- Offline aviability
- The spaceship vibrates when tapped on
- The ability to install the application on your mobile phone
- Stars that can be moved on the upper part of the phone's screen
- Parallax planets behind the spaceship that move with the spaceship
- Tutorial: If the user stucks for a couple of seconds a reminder will be shown on screen
- A spaceship that reacts differently based on the swiping gestures (left, right, up and down) that the user does (bottom part of the screen)
